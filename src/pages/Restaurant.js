                                    During my software development digital skills bootcamp, for our final project we split into groups of 4 and created full stack applications, for our full stack application we decided to mimic a real world example and create a mock takeaway ordering website. for the project we used APIs that give nutritional information, we also had a fully functional backend database that would store account information as well as orders linked to those accounts. This is the most technical project I have done so far and was extremely fun to work on, I was in charge of a lot of the database work including any functions that would access or manipulate the mongoDB database. Sadly, as this is a project with a database, it is not currently online due to the database owner needing to use their one free mongoDB database cluster for another project.

                                    As this was a collaborative project, a lot of my code had to be more readable and self explaining than normal so I held myself to a much higher standard than usual, my teammates also produced exceptional code and made use of multiple APIs to bring the web app to life. After the project was submitted I would consider it a fully functional takeaway website minus the paying at checkout and the restaurant itself. I recommend checking out the github <a href="https://github.com/TomKeny/Restaurant-Full-Stack" target="_blank">here</a>, it has links to the documents we used to plan and create the project which can give a clearer picture of our vision for the project.
