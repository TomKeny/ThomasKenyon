                        For our final projects on my unity game development bootcamp, we were given an industry project to complete, for our group I was team lead, our client asked for a VR application where you can build a modular factory with visible supply lines.Over the 4 weeks we were given, every friday we provided them with a presentation of all major updates on the project and I delivered a final 20 minute presentation to the clients in person at the end of the project.
                    <div className="borderline" />
                        The project itself went very well with our team having an exceptional 3D modeler as well as a talanted concept artist, our final product that we presented was considered one of the best they had had in years and I was very happy to recieve praise from my team for how well I supported my teammates and made sure that everything was communicated properly as well as any assistance being requested from lecturers immediately so that we could solve issues in a timely manner. I cannot go into more detail however due to an NDA I signed with the client before starting the project.
