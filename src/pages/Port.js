                        I understand that this is a bit meta but I consider this website one of my strongest projects, I used to have a basic portfolio however I was not happy with it and as I needed a portfolio for a university application I decided to completely rewrite my protfolio from the ground up, learning from my previous mistakes and putting more effort into the design and feel of it.
                    <div className="borderline" />
                        The code for this website is fairly typical for a react application although due to limitations with github pages I need to use hashrouting instead or regular routing to set up more pages, another minor issue I have ran into so far is working with different aspect ratios, I am researching ways to change the styling of the page based on the size of the window and will be implementing a way in the future, I am actively developing this site and you can check out the code for it <a href="https://github.com/TomKeny/ThomasKenyon" target="_blank">here</a>.
