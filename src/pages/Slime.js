                        Slime adventure is one of my greatest regrets, after finishing my software digital skills bootcamp I wanted to get back into game dev, to accomplish this I started teaching myself the godot game engine. I spent roughly 2 months creating lots of artwork and scripts for this game including multiple puzzles that made use of light and weight, sadly I never backed up the project and when swapping to a new pc, I lost a lot of files during the transfer, this included all of my godot projects.
                    <div className="borderline" />
                        The code for this project was split up into lots of smaller scripts with a focus on a "one script does one action" methodology and any data needed would come from a game manager script that managed all of the variables in the project, this also included saving the game using a json file to store and load save data, I still have some of the art assets although I will need to recreate a lot of them, I fully intend to rebuild this project in the future.
